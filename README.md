# chatbot
A simple chatbot using el if where the main idea was to understand how chatbots work at a basic level using simple programming logic instead of advanced AI.  

this task helped me understand a few important concepts clearly:

1.Input/Output Loops: I learned how to keep a program running and interacting continuously with the user using a while True loop.  
2.If-Elif-Else Conditions: I saw how logical conditions control the chatbot’s flow and how each condition decides what the bot should say.  
3.String Handling: Using .lower() taught me how to make text matching consistent regardless of case sensitivity.  
4.Basic NLP Structure: Even though I didn’t use any NLP libraries, I now understand the basic idea ,the chatbot takes input, processes it, and gives a response. It’s a small version of how real chatbots think and reply.
